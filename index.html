            <h3>Boston University COM CM 741 "Design and New Media" Projects</h3>
            <p>For this class, we were assigned to design a mobile app for a website that did not already have one. I chose <a href="https://www.thesill.com/">TheSill.com.</a> For part one, we were to redesign the logo and
                create wireframes for five different app pages that would represent different app functions. Below are the landing page, main menu of services, shopping page, shopping cart/checkout, and account page. 
                The wireframes were presented for peer review and feedback received was implemented into the final design.</p>

            <p>Below is the final design which simplified the landing page, added color, images, and a quick add button when on the shopping page.   </p>

            <p>This project is a redesign of the website <a href="https://saveadog.org/">SaveADog.org. </a>The final design incorporates some of the original colors used on the website and gives it a more modern look and feel. 
            The logo was resdesigned, the navigation bar is now solely at the top of the page, and the more pertinent information is shown right on the landing page.</p>

            <p>In addition to resdesigning the home page, I chose to redesign the page that lists dogs available for adoption. This uses a clean, minimalistic approach showing images of each dog, their name, age, and sex. 
                This page does not include any 'back' or 'next' buttons as users can scroll to see all dogs.</p>
