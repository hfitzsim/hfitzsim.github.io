            <h4>Mobile App Design</h4>
            <div class="description">
                <p>For this class, we were assigned to design a mobile app for a website that did not already have one. I chose <a href="https://www.thesill.com/">TheSill.com.</a> For part one, we were to redesign the logo and
                    create wireframes for five different app pages that would represent different app functions. Below are the landing page, main menu of services, shopping page, shopping cart/checkout, and account page. 
                    The wireframes were presented for peer review and feedback received was implemented into the final design.</p>

            <h4>Website Redesign</h4>
            <div class="description">
            <p>This project is a redesign of the website <a href="https://saveadog.org/">SaveADog.org. </a>The final design incorporates some of the original colors used on the website and gives it a more modern look and feel. 
            The logo was created with Adobe Illustrator, the navigation bar is now solely at the top of the page, and the most pertinent information to potential adopters is shown right on the landing page.</p>

            <div class="description">
            <p>In addition to resdesigning the home page, I chose to redesign the page that lists dogs available for adoption. This takes a clean, minimalistic approach, showing images of each dog, their name, age, and sex. 
                This page does not include any 'back' or 'next' buttons as users can scroll to see all dogs. Contact information remains visible in the footer until all dogs have loaded and can be viewed. </p>
